# Task-02: Image Generation using Pre-trained Models

For this task, I used a pre-trained model (DALL·E Mini) to generate images from text prompts.

## Prompts Used:
- "A cat sitting on the moon"
- "A white cat under stars"

## Output Images:
The generated images (image cat and image cat 2) are included in this repository.

This completes Task-02 for my Generative AI Internship at Prodigy InfoTech.
